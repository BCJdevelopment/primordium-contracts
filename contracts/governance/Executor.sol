/**
 * @dev Contract module which acts as a timelocked controller. When set as the
 * owner of an `Ownable` smart contract, it enforces a timelock on all
 * `onlyOwner` maintenance operations. This gives time for users of the
 * controlled contract to exit before a potentially dangerous maintenance
 * operation is applied.
 *
 * By default, this contract is self administered, meaning administration tasks
 * have to go through the timelock process. The proposer (resp executor) role
 * is in charge of proposing (resp executing) operations. A common use case is
 * to position this {Executor} as the owner of a smart contract, with
 * a multisig or a DAO as the sole proposer.
