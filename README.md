# Primordium Contracts

The Primordium framework is a set of smart-contracts designed to allow a DAO to form and operate as an on-chain business. The contracts feature a fully decentralized formation process (with no centralized multi-sigs or airdrops). Anyone can permissionlessly join or leave the DAO at any time.

*PrimordiumDAO is officially live on ethereum mainnet! Anyone can join at [app.primordiumdao.xyz](https://app.primordiumdao.xyz).*
