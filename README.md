# Primordium Contracts

The Primordium framework is a set of smart-contracts designed to allow a DAO to form and operate as a business. The smart contracts feature a fully decentralized formation process, with no centralized multi-sigs or airdrops.

The framework is inspired by the [Compound Governance](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol) protocol, and architecturally follows the modular [OpenZeppelin Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance) contracts. However, many contracts have been heavily modified to allow decentralized DAO formation and full business capabilities.
