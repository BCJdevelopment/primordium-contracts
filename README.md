# Primordium Contracts

The Primordium framework is a set of smart-contracts designed to allow a DAO to form and operate as a business.

The framework is based on the [Compound Governance](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol) protocol, and makes several modifications to allow more business features.
